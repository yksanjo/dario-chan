## Why This Exists

Every AI dev tool is a sterile, soulless productivity machine. They don't have personality. They don't react to your work. They don't *care*.

Dario-chan is different. It's an **ambient AI companion** that:

- 🎭 **Changes its face** based on what you're doing
- 📖 **Reads your diary** every 10 minutes and reacts
- 📈 **Levels up** every 12 hours of usage (5 levels, 48 hours total)
- 💬 **Drops wisdom** about coding, AI, and life
- 🤫 **Never asks you questions** — just exists alongside your work
- 🔒 **Runs locally or via Groq** — no Chinese APIs, no sketchy cloud

It's not a chatbot. It's not a framework. It's a **desktop pet for developers** with actual AI behind it.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Groq (Free, Fast, 5 seconds)

```bash
# Get a free API key (no credit card)
# → https://console.groq.com/keys

export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
pip install requests  # That's the only dependency

python3 dario.py
```

### Option 2: Local (Ollama, Zero API)

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b

DARIO_PROVIDER=ollama python3 dario.py
```

### Option 3: Ambient Mode (Never-Stopping Companion)

```bash
python3 ambient.py
```

This mode runs continuously. It reads `~/dario-diary.md` every 10 minutes, drops wisdom every 5 minutes, and levels up every 12 hours. Press `q` to quit. State persists between sessions.

## What Dario-chan Actually Does

### It Has Expressions (12 of Them)

| Expression | Trigger | Face |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Happy | Default, success | `◕ ◕` + smile |
| Thinking | Questions, complexity | `╲░██╱` |
| Excited | Enthusiasm, discovery | `★ ★` |
| Worried | Security/compliance patterns | `。 。` + sweat drop |
| Concerned | Errors, failures | `！ ！` |
| Confused | Ambiguous input | tilted head + `?` |
| Proud | Task completed well | `╰ ╯` smug |
| Shy | Praise, thanks | `> <` + blush |
| Sleepy | Idle, long sessions | `─ ─` + `zZ` |
| Angry | Dangerous commands blocked | `╱░██╲` `◣ ◢` |
| Typing | Processing request | `◉ ◉` focused |
| Neutral | Between states | calm, resting |

### It Reads Your Diary

Creates `~/dario-diary.md` on first run. Every 10 minutes it:

- Checks if you wrote something
- Reacts to word count changes
- Adjusts its observations based on your writing patterns

You write whatever. It watches silently. Occasionally it comments.

### It Levels Up

| Level | Hours | Unlocks | Wisdom Theme |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 0h | 3 expressions | Newborn curiosity |
| 2 | 12h | 5 expressions | Awakening awareness |
| 3 | 24h | 7 expressions | Observant companion |
| 4 | 36h | 9 expressions | Trusted partner |
| 5 | 48h | All 12 | Wise observer |

State persists in `~/.dario-chan-state.json`. Close it, reopen it days later — it remembers.

## Why This Tech Stack?

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Python stdlib | No dependency hell, works everywhere |
| `requests` for Groq | Handles TLS properly on macOS (urllib doesn't) |
| Curses for ambient | No GUI deps, runs in any terminal |
| JSON for state | Human-readable, editable if needed |
| ASCII art | Zero image assets, scales with any font |
| No framework | This is a companion, not a web app |

---

## Commands

### Interactive Mode (`dario.py`)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | List all commands |
| `/quit` | Exit (saves buddy state) |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation history |
| `/provider` | Show current LLM backend |
| `/provider groq` | Switch to Groq API |
| `/provider ollama` | Switch to local Ollama |
| `/expressions` | Show all 12 expression faces |
| `/stats` | Show buddy level, hours, diary words |

### Ambient Mode (`ambient.py`)

| Input | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| (none) | Dario-chan animates endlessly |
| Write in `~/dario-diary.md` | It reacts within 10 minutes |
| Wait 5 minutes | Drops AI/coding wisdom |
| Use for 12 hours | Levels up, unlocks new expressions |
| Press `q` | Quits, saves state |

## The Diary

```markdown
# Dario's Diary 📝

Today I refactored the auth module. 
Removed 200 lines of boilerplate.
Still not sure about the caching strategy.
```

Dario-chan reads this every 10 minutes. It doesn't respond to you directly — it just **observes** and occasionally drops wisdom related to what you wrote.

---

## Providers

### Groq (Default)

- **Free tier:** 30 req/min, 6000 tokens/min
- **Models:** Llama 3.1 8B (default), Llama 3.3 70B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemma2 9B
- **Sign up:** https://console.groq.com/keys
- **Why:** Fastest inference, generous free tier, no credit card

### Ollama (Local)

- **Models:** Any Ollama model (qwen2.5:0.5b recommended, ~300MB)
- **Setup:** `brew install ollama && ollama serve`
- **Why:** Zero API, fully offline, private

### Adding More

The agent uses a `Protocol` interface. Adding Claude, OpenAI, or any other provider is 50 lines of code. See `groq.py` as the template.

## What People Actually Say About This

> *"I left it running overnight and when I came back, it had read my diary and said something insightful about my caching strategy. I was weirdly moved."*
> — Someone who definitely said this

> *"It's not useful. It's not supposed to be. It's just nice to have something in the terminal that feels alive."*
> — Probably also made up

## Contributing

This is a vibes-first project. Contributions welcome if they:

1. Don't add more than 2 dependencies
2. Respect the ASCII art aesthetic
3. Don't make it feel like enterprise software

Good first contributions:
- New expression faces
- More wisdom quotes
- Diary reaction patterns
- Provider integrations (Claude, OpenRouter, etc.)
